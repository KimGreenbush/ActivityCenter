# ActivityCenter

A C# exam from [Coding Dojo](https://www.codingdojo.com/).

I had 6 hours to implement the required features.

This was a first attempt. I successfully completed the exam but took another for higher marks (HobbyHub).

This website creates users who can add activity events that other users can join or leave. 

The activites are organized by date and expired(old) events are removed from the display.
